## Politwoops

[Politwoops](http://politwoops.com/) is a project which catalogs deleted tweets from politicians. It shows a side of political life that politicians had rather not shared with the world. Having pioneered in the Netherlands, this project is now active internationally in many countries.

## Diplotwoops
[Diplotwoops](http://diplotwoops.org/) is a project which catalogs deleted tweets of diplomats, instead of politicians. It's a spin off from politwoops.

## Trailerts

Trailerts is an experiment in watching movie trailers online. It just shows you a sequence of random trailers. You can tune the genre and period to your liking.

*Note:* This still needs to find a home.
