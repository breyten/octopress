As a tradition, I always open the new year with a blog post about my travels in the past year:

* Amsterdam*
* Zeewolde
* Antananarivo, Madagascar*
* Antsirabe, Madgascar
* Ranohira, Madagascar*
* Ifaty, Madagascar
* Manajary, Madgascar
* Toamasina, Madagascar
* The Hague
* Barcelona, Spain

One or more nights were spent in each place. Those cities marked with an * were visited multiple times on non-consecutive days.
