I have an external monitor connected to my Macbook when I'm at work. However,
managing that is a real pain, as I was dragging windows around the monitors
everytime I connected to it. Luckily, there's an application which takes the
pain away: [Multimon](http://multimonapp.com/).

Multimon has several options. The most noticeable is that it turns on a menu bar
on the external monitor. This saves a lot of mouse movements. And if you don't
like this, you can turn it off.

Additionally, Multimon has hotkeys enabled to move windows around your monitors.
This is a life saver. Quickly move windows around when you need them, and move
them out of the way when you're done with them.

But it gets even better: Multimon also remembers which monitor each window was on
and rearranges them when you connect to it. And this is the thing that boosts my
productivity the most.
