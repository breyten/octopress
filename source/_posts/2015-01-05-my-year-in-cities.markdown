As a tradition, I always open the new year with a blog post about my travels in the past year:

* Amsterdam*
* Bangkok, Thailand*
* Chiang Mai, Thailand
* Chiang Rai, Thailand
* Pak Beng, Laos
* Luang Prabang, Laos
* Vang Vieng, Laos
* Vientiane, Laos
* Siem Reap, Cambodia
* Phnom Penh, Cambodia
* Eindhoven
* Berlin, Germany
* Taipei, Thailand
* Arcen

One or more nights were spent in each place. Those cities marked with an * were visited multiple times on non-consecutive days.
