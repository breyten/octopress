As a tradition, I always open the new year with a blog post about my travels in the past year:

* Amsterdam*
* Namur, Belgium
* The Hague
* Eindhoven
* Negombo, Sri Lanka
* Anuradhapuha, Sri Lanka
* Trincomallee, Sri Lanka
* Polonnaruwa, Sri Lanka
* Kandy, Sri Lanka
* Nuwara Elya, Sri Lanka
* Mirissa, Sri Lanka
* Galle, Sri Lanka
* Berlin, Germany

One or more nights were spent in each place. Those cities marked with an * were visited multiple times on non-consecutive days.
