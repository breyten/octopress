I'm using [ProPublica](http://www.propublica.org/)'s [Document Viewer](https://github.com/documentcloud/document-viewer) in a project and I needed to figure out how to keep track of the current page the user is viewing. It turns out that you can do this, but it required a bit of hacking.

The Document Viewer is a full-fledged project and it's well structured, as it has models, events and the likes. The first thing I did was figuring out if there was an event firing after the entire document was fully loaded (a la jQuery's [ready event](http://api.jquery.com/ready/)). It turns out there are two ways to do achieve this kind of functionality. The easiest is to assign a function to the `afterLoad` key in the options you pass to `DV.load`. The other way is to extend the `DV` object with an added function `afterLoad` which is automatically called if it is implemented. 

Here is sample code to register the `afterload` function via the options:

``` javascript
var CURRENT_DOCUMENT = DV.load("https://documentcloud.org/documents/" + dc_slug + ".js", {
  container : '#doc',
  width     : 660,
  height    : 900,
  zoom      : 'auto',
  showSidebar : false,
  embedded  : true,
  showAnnotations : true,
  afterLoad : function (v) {
    console.log('afterload called via options!');
  }
});
```

The code to achieve the same by extending the `DV` object is shorter. You might want to use it -- I prefer the following over defining functions in hashes:

``` javascript
DV.afterLoad = function(v) {
  console.log('DV.afterLoad has fired!');
};
```

In order to track the page view we need to register an event handler. The document model has an array called `onPageChangeCallbacks`, which is exactly what we need. This is how you register the callback:

``` javascript
var currentPage;

DV.afterLoad = function(v) {
  console.log('DV.afterLoad has fired!');
  CURRENT_DOCUMENT.models.document.onPageChangeCallbacks.push(
    function () {
      currentPage = CURRENT_DOCUMENT.models.document.currentPage();
      console.log('page changed! We are on page ' + currentPage + ' now');
      // do something here
    }
  );
};
```

Thhe callbacks are fired when you click the previous/next button in the viewer, but also when you're scrolling, so all bases are covered.
